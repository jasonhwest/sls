							<h4>Mom Coaching:</h4>
							<p>Many new moms report feeling overwhelmed with their new baby and unsure of how they are going to make it through the next few months, much less the next few days! Mom Coaching offers phone consultations for new moms on important parenting issues such as sleep patterns, feeding, attachment, and self care.</p>
							<h4>Addictions Coaching:</h4>
							<p>Our addictions coaching services offer individuals and family support services through a 5 session intensive method.  If additional services are needed after the initial intensive, the {Simplified} professional will continue in consulting or refer to qualified addiction inpatient or outpatient service as necessary.</p>
							<h4>Additional Services Coming Soon:</h4>
							<p>Tutoring and Academic Organizational Coaching (check <a href="http://blog.simplifiedatlanta.com" target="slspage">blog</a> for updates)</p>
