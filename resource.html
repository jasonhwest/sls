							<h4>Recommendations</h4>
							<blockquote>
								<p>"Emily is wise beyond her years and meeting with her has been the best decision I've made in my adult life.  This has been the best investment and has had the biggest impact on my understanding my past and moving forward today."</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>“My journey as a graduate student through the past couple years has been one of a rollercoaster, to say the least. It felt like the darkness was caving in and the pressure was becoming too much to handle. Every day was a constant uphill battle that I felt forced to get through. All of that changed once I began counseling with Emily Shupert. Emily has provided me with the tools necessary to cope with any situation that life throws at me, whether dealing with school-related stress or personal and family relationships. I am now better able to understand myself and not only how I act, but also react to various circumstances. Emily is a truly exceptional counselor, who deeply cares about her clients, and I know that my own personal journey has been enhanced due to her services.”</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>“I began counseling as a fearful and anxious girl that didn’t know what was right or wrong with me. I just knew the path I was on was a vicious circle of depression. I was tired of the clichéd phrases from my loved ones to hang in there and that things would get better. I needed someone that got it, someone that got me. I didn’t know where to begin that first session, but it turns out I didn’t need a grand speech to eloquently explain my pain. She understood exactly where I was coming from and assured me that her goal was to walk with me and help me thrive again.”</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>“Since my first session Emily has aided me to see and unpack the fears and lies that I have believed about myself for years.  The tools are in you; sometimes you just need that one person to help you see them. The fear is always being stuck in a pattern of life, but counseling allows you to turn a corner. I can honestly say that my life is different now since turning that corner.  I wouldn't trade my Monday sessions for anything!”</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>When I walked into Lauren Dack's office I was expecting what I experienced with all of my previous therapists; to feel like a project or to have the constant uneasy feeling that they were going to try and discover what was "wrong" with me. However, this was not the case with Lauren.  Almost instantly I felt that I could trust and open up to Lauren about my problems and my thoughts, which was hard to tell even the people closest to me. Everything about Lauren, from the way she spoke, her eye contact, and her body language showed me that she truly did care and was interested about my life and who I was as a person.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Lauren has impacted my life in such a positive way and I will be forever grateful for the time I was able to spend with her.  I laughed with her, cried with her, learned a great deal about myself, and what I could accomplish.  I felt her faith in my capabilities as a person and that truly gave me more strength, hope, and belief that I could get through anything.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Lauren is such a wise, caring, and genuine person.  She was the best therapist I have ever had and I know in my heart that I will never find anyone to replace her or encounter anyone who can provide such an amazing impact on my life as she did.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Randy, your help incredible encouragement and perspective have been huge.  You are a great counselor and mentor!</p>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<p>I wanted to thank Randy for being a great inspiration and catalyst that helped me believe that making positive steps and reaching my goals could become a reality for me!  I am forever grateful for his time and conversations that helped guide my thought process and decisions.</p>
